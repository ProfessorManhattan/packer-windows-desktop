## Usage

All of the usage instructions can be found by running `{{ binName }} --help`. After running the command, you should be greeted with the following output:

```
{{ help_menu_output }}
```

### Man Page

Alternatively, if you installed the package via NPM or an installer that set up the man page (e.g. `.deb` or `.rpm`), then you can find usage instructions by running `man {{ binName }}`.
